# DEPI-Project-Team2  
# 🤖 AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Equipment

## 📌 Project Overview
This project leverages **Machine Learning (ML)** and **IoT sensor data** (e.g., vibration, temperature, pressure, humidity) to **predict equipment failures before they occur**.  

By forecasting potential breakdowns, businesses can:
- Reduce costly downtime  
- Optimize maintenance schedules  
- Extend machinery lifespan  
- Enhance overall operational efficiency  

The solution integrates **AI-driven analytics** with **real-time sensor data** to deliver a robust predictive maintenance system.
